### Description
Rotation in two dimension only takes one variable $theta$ to specify the transformation. Rotation in three dimension 
takes three variables to specify the transformation, namely theta x, theta y and theta x. For those who have come across
Euler equation know that the rotation matrix is a mess. Alternatively, Lie's idea gives a powerful method to generate
the three dimension rotation matrix. Even better, it could be used to generate the rotation in a higher dimension space.
